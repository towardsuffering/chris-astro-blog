## 3. Getting Started with Discovery

### 3.1. Installation and Setup

Before using the Discovery module, ensure you have Finance Toolkit installed and properly configured:

```python
# Install the financetoolkit package
pip install financetoolkit -U

# Import the Discovery module
from financetoolkit import Discovery

# Initialize with your API key
discovery = Discovery(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

### 3.2. Basic Instrument Discovery

The module provides several methods to list available instruments:

```python
# Get a list of all available stocks
stocks = discovery.get_stock_list()

# Search for specific instruments
apple_instruments = discovery.search_instruments("Apple")

# Get forex quotes
forex_quotes = discovery.get_forex_quotes()
```

### 3.3. Advanced Stock Screening

One of the most powerful features is the stock screener, which allows you to filter stocks based on multiple criteria:

```python
screened_stocks = discovery.get_stock_screener(
    market_cap_higher=1000000,
    market_cap_lower=200000000000,
    price_higher=100,
    price_lower=200,
    beta_higher=1,
    beta_lower=1.5,
    volume_higher=100000,
    volume_lower=2000000,
    dividend_higher=1,
    dividend_lower=2,
    is_etf=False
)
```

This screen would find stocks that meet the following criteria:

- Market cap between $1M and $200B
- Price between $100 and $200
- Beta between 1 and 1.5
- Daily volume between 100K and 2M shares
- Dividend yield between 1% and 2%
- Excludes ETFs

### 3.4. Market Movers Analysis

The Discovery module makes it easy to track market momentum:

```python
# Get top gainers
gainers = discovery.get_biggest_gainers()

# Get top losers
losers = discovery.get_biggest_losers()

# Get most active stocks
active = discovery.get_most_active_stocks()
```

### 3.5. Integration with Finance Toolkit

The Discovery module seamlessly integrates with other Finance Toolkit capabilities:

```python
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

# Get tickers from screener
tickers = screened_stocks.index.tolist()

# Initialize Toolkit with discovered tickers
companies = Toolkit(tickers=tickers, api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Analyze historical data
historical_data = companies.get_historical_data()
```

## 4. Best Practices and Tips

1. **API Usage:**

   - Monitor your API call limits (250/day for free accounts)
   - Cache results when performing repeated searches
   - Use specific search criteria to minimize unnecessary API calls

2. **Screening Strategy:**

   - Start with broad criteria and gradually narrow down
   - Consider market conditions when setting screening parameters
   - Combine multiple screening criteria for more precise results

3. **Data Management:**

   - Export screening results to CSV for offline analysis
   - Document screening criteria for reproducibility
   - Regular updates to capture changing market conditions

4. **Integration Workflow:**
   - Define clear research objectives before screening
   - Plan how discovered instruments will be analyzed
   - Create systematic processes for regular market scanning

## 5. Common Challenges and Solutions

1. **API Limits:**

   - Challenge: Reaching daily API call limits
   - Solution: Cache results and batch processing

2. **Data Availability:**

   - Challenge: Missing data for some instruments
   - Solution: Implement proper error handling and validation

3. **Performance:**

   - Challenge: Slow processing with large datasets
   - Solution: Use efficient filtering and limit initial scope

4. **Market Coverage:**
   - Challenge: Limited coverage in free tier
   - Solution: Focus on major markets or upgrade to premium
