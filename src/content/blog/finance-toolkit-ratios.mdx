## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the third installment of mastering financial analysis with the Finance Toolkit. In this guide, we will take an in-depth look at the **Ratios Module**—a powerful feature that allows you to evaluate a company's performance using a wide variety of financial ratios. Understanding these ratios is crucial for investors, analysts, and anyone interested in assessing the financial health of companies. With over **50 financial ratios** available, the Finance Toolkit's Ratios Module provides an incredibly comprehensive way to analyze company performance. These include **custom ratios**, as well as specific categories like **efficiency**, **profitability**, **liquidity**, **solvency**, and **valuation** ratios.

For a step-by-step guide to get started with the Finance Toolkit, check out my [Getting Started with Finance Toolkit](https://chrisblogs.dev/post/finance-toolkit-getting-started/) blog post.

The interactive chart below illustrates the power of the Finance Toolkit, showcasing its capabilities in visualizing financial metrics effectively--allowing analysts to glean important insights about the competition. This chart provides a glimpse of **Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Walmart** using some of the most commonly used ratios, but remember, the power of the Finance Toolkit goes much further beyond this.

This chart allows you to explore various financial ratios for Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Walmart over time. Use the dropdown menu to filter between metrics like **Return on Assets (ROA)**, **Return on Equity (ROE)**, **Current Ratio**, **Quick Ratio**, **Asset Turnover Ratio**, and **Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio**. By analyzing these ratios, you can gain real-world insights into how these companies have performed financially, identifying key trends and distinctions among them:

- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: Amazon's ROA shows fluctuations, suggesting variability in how effectively it utilizes assets, while Meta maintains more consistent asset efficiency.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Amazon displays high variance in ROE, indicating periods of fluctuating profitability, whereas Apple maintains stable returns on equity, reflecting steady shareholder returns.
- **Current Ratio**: Meta consistently has the highest current ratio, highlighting its strong ability to meet short-term obligations compared to its peers.
- **Quick Ratio**: Meta also leads in quick ratio, particularly in 2020, indicating strong liquidity and minimal reliance on inventory to meet liabilities.
- **Asset Turnover Ratio**: Walmart stands out with the highest asset turnover, demonstrating its superior ability to generate sales from its assets year over year.
- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Amazon's P/E ratio shows significant volatility, especially during 2022, reflecting varying market expectations and valuation challenges.

This guide will walk you through setting up the Ratios Module, understanding various types of financial ratios, and interpreting them to uncover meaningful insights. We'll explore key profitability, liquidity, efficiency, leverage, and valuation ratios, ensuring you have a comprehensive understanding of what each metric reveals about a company.

## 3. Setting Up the Ratios Module

Before diving into analyzing financial ratios, let's make sure we have the Ratios Module set up correctly. Here’s how to get started:

```python
# Install the financetoolkit package using `pip`
pip install financetoolkit -U

# Import the Toolkit
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

# Set up API access to FMP
API_KEY = "FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_API_KEY"

# Initialize the Toolkit with company tickers
companies = Toolkit(
    ["AAPL", "AMZN", "META", "WMT"], api_key=API_KEY, start_date="2005-01-01"
)
```

With the Toolkit set up, you're ready to start analyzing a company's financial health using various ratios.

## 4. Using the Ratios Module to Analyze AAPL, AMZN, META, and WMT

To gain deeper insights into the financial health and performance of Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Walmart (WMT), we'll analyze key financial ratios.

roa_ratios = companies.ratios.get_return_on_assets()
print(roa_ratios)
```
