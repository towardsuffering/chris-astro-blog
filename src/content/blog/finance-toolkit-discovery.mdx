## 3. Setting Up the Discovery Module

Before we begin exploring the Discovery Module, make sure you have the Finance Toolkit installed and set up. Below is a visual flowchart to help you understand the setup process step-by-step, ensuring you get started quickly.

```python
# Install the financetoolkit package using `pip`
pip install financetoolkit -U

# Import the Discovery Module
from financetoolkit.discovery import Discovery

# Set up API access to FMP
API_KEY = "FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_API_KEY"

discovery = Discovery(api_key=API_KEY)
```

## 4. Using the Discovery Module

The Discovery Module provides several ways to find stocks and other financial instruments that meet your investment criteria. Imagine you are looking for a stock that has a stable price with moderate growth potential—this is where the Discovery Module shines. Let's go through the key features, starting with stock discovery.

### 4.1. Stock List

To get a complete list of available stocks, we use the `get_stock_list()` function. This function provides access to over 60,000 rows of stock data, allowing you to explore a comprehensive range of global equities.

```python
stock_list = discovery.get_stock_list()

# The total list equals over 60.000 rows
stock_list.iloc[38000:38010]
```

Analyzing **sector performance** helps you understand which sectors are leading or lagging in the market, providing insight into broader economic trends.

### 4.5. Biggest Gainers and Losers

To identify market trends, you can use the **biggest gainers** and **biggest losers** functions to see which stocks have seen the most movement in recent trading sessions.

```python
# Assuming `discovery` is already defined as in your example
gainers_df = discovery.get_biggest_gainers()

# Sort the result by '% Change' in descending order
sorted_gainers_df = gainers_df.sort_values(by='Change %', ascending=False)

# Display the sorted DataFrame
display(sorted_gainers_df)
```

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">

| Symbol | Name                        | Change | Price  | Change % |

# Sort the result by '% Change' in descending order
sorted_losers_df = losers_df.sort_values(by='Change %', ascending=True)

# Display the sorted DataFrame
display(sorted_losers_df)
```

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
