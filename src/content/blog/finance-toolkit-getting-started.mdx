## 3. Gathering Financial Data

In financial analysis, gathering accurate and relevant data is the first step. The Finance Toolkit simplifies this process by providing functions to collect and parse various types of financial data. Let's explore how to retrieve and interpret this data.

### 3.1. Install and Setup

The required dependencies must be installed before the toolkit class can be implemented.

```python
# Install the financetoolkit package using `pip`
pip install financetoolkit -U

# Import modules
from financetoolkit import Toolkit

# Set up API access to FMP
API_KEY = "FINANCIAL_MODELING_PREP_API_KEY"
```

**Key Takeaway:** Understanding how to set up your development environment is important for any Python project, especially when working with financial data that requires API access.

### 3.2. Initiate Toolkit

The Toolkit class must be initialized to analyze financial data.

```python
# Initialize the Toolkit with company tickers, API key, start date, and benchmark ticker
companies = Toolkit(
    ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN"],
    api_key=API_KEY,
    start_date="2005-01-01",
    benchmark_ticker="SPY"
)
```

**Key Takeaway:** Learning to initialize objects with specific parameters allows you to customize your financial analysis for different companies and time periods. **Note:** additional parameters can be found in the [documentation](https://www.jeroenbouma.com/projects/financetoolkit/docs).

### 3.3 Get Financial Data

To conduct a comprehensive financial analysis, we need various types of data, including historical stock prices and financial statements. The Finance Toolkit allows us to retrieve this data efficiently.

#### 3.3.1. Historical Stock Price Data

Historical stock price data is fundamental for analyzing a company's market performance over time. Using the Finance Toolkit, we can easily retrieve this data:

```python
# Daily historical data
companies.get_historical_data()
```

![Get Historical Data](../../assets/images/display_historicals.png)

This function returns a DataFrame containing daily historical price data for our selected companies (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN) and the benchmark (SPY) from 2005 to 2024. It includes Open, High, Low, Close prices, Volume, and calculated metrics like Cumulative Return and Volatility.

The power of this data lies in its ability to show trends over time. For instance, we can visualize cumulative returns to compare the performance of different companies:

<PlotlyLineChart />

This chart shows total investment returns for Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon from 2006 to 2024. Apple leads dramatically, especially post-2019, reaching nearly 250% return. Amazon follows with high but volatile growth. Google and Microsoft show steady but slower growth. This metric is crucial as it reflects total value creation, including capital gains and reinvested dividends. It demonstrates each company's success in their markets - Apple's expansion into smartphones and services, Amazon's e-commerce dominance, Google's ad revenue consistency, and Microsoft's cloud pivot. For investors, it clearly illustrates long-term wealth generation potential in the tech sector.

#### 3.3.2. Income Statement

The Income Statement shows a company's revenues and expenses over a specific period:

```python
companies.get_income_statement()
```

![Get Income Statement](../../assets/images/get_is.png)

This statement tells the story of a company's profitability. It's important to remember that while revenues are generally straightforward, many expenses involve management decisions and accounting rules. Analyzing trends in revenues, expenses, and profit margins can reveal a lot about a company's operational efficiency and competitive position.

<PlotlyIncomeStatementChart />

`Net income` is a crucial measure of a company's profitability. Apple consistently leads, reflecting its high-margin products and efficient operations. Microsoft shows strong growth, likely due to its cloud services and software dominance. Google maintains steady profits from its advertising business. Amazon's fluctuating net income may reflect its strategy of reinvesting heavily in growth. This metric is vital as it directly impacts shareholder value and a company's ability to fund future innovations.

#### 3.3.3. Balance Sheet

The Balance Sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a specific point in time:

```python
companies.get_balance_sheet_statement()
```

![Get Balance Sheet](../../assets/images/get_bs.png)

This statement is based on the accounting equation: `Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity`. It's crucial to understand that many values on the Balance Sheet are based on estimates and assumptions. Analyzing the Balance Sheet can provide insights into a company's liquidity, solvency, and overall financial flexibility.

<PlotlyStackedBar />

`Shareholders equity` represents the total value of a company owned by its shareholders. Microsoft and Google show significant growth in shareholder equity, indicating strong retained earnings and possibly successful equity offerings. Apple's relatively stable equity suggests consistent returns to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Amazon's growing equity reflects its strategy of reinvesting profits. High shareholder equity can provide a buffer during economic downturns and fuel future growth, making it a key indicator of long-term financial health.

#### 3.3.4. Cash Flow Statement

The Cash Flow Statement shows how changes in balance sheet accounts and income affect cash and cash equivalents:

```python
companies.get_cash_flow_statement()
```

![Get Cash Flow Statement](../../assets/images/get_scf.png)

This statement is often considered the most important, as it reconciles the profitability reported on the Income Statement with the actual cash generated by the business. It's divided into operating, investing, and financing activities, providing a comprehensive view of how a company generates and uses its cash.

Once we've retrieved the financial statements, we can analyze specific data points. For example, let's examine the Total Shareholder Equity for our companies over time:

```python
# Save to a variable for easier access
balance_sheet = companies.get_balance_sheet_statement()

# Plot the value of Total Shareholder Equity for each company in 2022
shareholder_value = balance_sheet.loc[
    (companies._tickers, "Total Shareholder Equity"), :"2022"
].T
shareholder_value.columns = companies._tickers
shareholder_value.plot.bar(
    figsize=(15, 3),
    title="Total Shareholder Equity over the Years",
    grid=True,
    colormap="inferno",
    rot=0,
    xlabel="Date",
    ylabel="Total Shareholder Equity",
    stacked=True,
)
```

<PlotlyCashFlowsChart />

`Free cash flow` shows a company's ability to generate cash after accounting for capital expenditures. Apple leads in this metric, demonstrating its efficiency in converting revenue to cash. Microsoft and Google also show strong and growing free cash flow, indicating robust operational efficiency. Amazon's lower free cash flow might reflect its heavy investments in infrastructure and new technologies. This metric is crucial as it represents the cash a company can use for acquisitions, debt repayment, dividends, or reinvestment, directly impacting its ability to create future value for shareholders.

These stacked bar charts show the total shareholder equity for each company from 2019 to 2022. Such a visualization can reveal trends in company growth and financial strength over time.
